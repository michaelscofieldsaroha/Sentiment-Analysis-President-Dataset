#Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the process of detecting positive or negative sentiment in text. It’s often used by businesses to detect sentiment in social data, gauge brand reputation, and understand customers’ likes & dislikes. Since customers express their thoughts and feelings more openly than ever before, sentiment analysis is becoming an essential tool to monitor and understand that sentiment. Automatically analyzing customer feedback, such as opinions in survey responses and social media conversations, allows brands to learn what makes customers happy or frustrated. By virtue of knowing customer preference and feedback, companies are able to timely tailor products & services to meet their customers’ needs and expectations. For example, using sentiment analysis to automatically analyze 4,000+ reviews about your product could help you discover if customers are happy about your product acceptance and its value for money.
